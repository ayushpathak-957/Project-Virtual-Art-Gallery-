    <p>
      This <i>breathtaking, world icon,</i> Japanese wood block print is a
      wonderful example of the <u>use of line.</u> Line is a major feature of
      printmaking processes and for this reason, it is always a good idea to
      examine print made artworks. None is more famous than
      <b>“The Great Wave”</b>, which not only uses line to create the waves and
      the details the water which appears to be coming down to claw its victims,
      but uses line to create depth with the Japanese mountain in the background
      that echoes the waves in the foreground. Line is apparent
      <del>short</del> throughout the waves to show the motion and movement in
      the curves and the rolls of the waves, as well as the texture.

    <p>
      This Van Gogh Self-Portrait is an example of
      <u>how line or strokes can be used to create an art piece.</u> This
      painting is created using lines or strokes of paint and also with implied
      lines.This art piece also demonstrates the artist's understanding of
      <b>neo-impressionist technique,</b> as well as his understanding of
      <i>color theory </i> (the colors he uses are both warm/cold for contrast
      to create a <del>illusion</del> focal point, and complementary. )

    <img src="5.webp" height="auto" width="50%" />
    <p>

      earring. <br />
      The work is admired for its subtle use of light, <i>soft realism</i>, and
      <u>mysterious expression</u>. Earlier, it was

      (a study of facial expression).
